# Towards a fair experimental comparison for Neural Architecture Search in Super Resolution

This repository contains the elements necessary to apply the evaluation protocol found in **"A fair experimental comparison for NAS in super-resolution"**.

This Protocol seeks to allow similarity of conditions for the proper contrast between different neural architecture search procedures. Establishing a group of data sets used during training and testing of architecutres at two stages of the neural architecture search.

Moreover this protocol extend the current literature by enforcing the use of statistical analysis of the results to motive a more sounding discussion on the significance of observable results. This way providing better insights on the significance of the observable results and their practical relevance.

# Data sets

For practicallity data sets are not included within this repository. Nonetheless, we include a direct link for downloading these sets, being the ones used for experimentation on the article that this supplementary material accompanies. *(To download datasets: <a href="url">doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/MXNV9)</a>*
